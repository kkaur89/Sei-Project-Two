## Project Overview

This was a pair coding project, where we were briefed to build a React app using an public API. my coding partner and I chose Cocktails DB API as it is something that appealed to us both and would allow us to be playful with the design. 

This API had many different endpoints, allowing you to search by ingredient, name etc. This then allowed us to make multiple requests and add more features for the user.
